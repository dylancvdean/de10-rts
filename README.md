# DE-10 Nano Real Time Spectrogram

This is part of a capstone project created by students at Montana State University.
It creates an SD card image for the DE-10 Nano that runs a graphical desktop
environment to run our spectrogram software.

## Requirements

- A Micro SD card of minimum 2 GB, for example the one that came with your
  DE10-nano kit.
- Windows, Mac or Linux based computer with a (micro)SD card reader.
- An SD card flash utility.

## Instructions

### Step 1

Download the latest version from the [releases](https://github.com/MiSTer-devel/mr-fusion/releases) page.

### Step 2

Download and install an SD card flash utility for your system. Here are
a few example in no particular order:

- [Apple Pi Baker](https://www.tweaking4all.com/software/macosx-software/applepi-baker-v2/)
- [balenaEtcher](https://www.balena.io/etcher/)
- [Win32 Disk Imager](https://sourceforge.net/projects/win32diskimager/)

Refer to the documentation of the SD card flash utility for more information.

### Step 3

Follow your SD card flash utility's instructions to flash the downloaded image
onto your SD card.

_Note: Extract the downloaded SD card image zip file if your SD card flash utility
does not support flashing zip files!_
